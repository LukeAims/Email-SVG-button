# Hi, welcome to my project

## For this project I recreated the **SVG** animated buttion, origionaly by *Sabine Robart*

The code creates a simple user interface with a button that allows the user to send an email. The button is created with two labels, one for the "Send mail" text and the other for the "Reset" text. When the user clicks on the "Send mail" label, it activates a checkbox (which is hidden) that triggers some animations. Two **SVG** icons of a mail envelope and an airplane are also displayed.

The **SCSS** code is used to style the different elements of the user interface, like the color, size, and position of the labels and icons, the animations, and the shapes and colors of the circles surrounding the icons.

Overall, this code snippet creates a simple, interactive user interface for sending an email, using **HTML** and **SCSS**.
